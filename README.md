Code worksheet for using the java 8 streaming api

This example is adapted from the article [A Java 8 Streams Cookbook](https://dzone.com/articles/a-java-8-streams-cookbook) from DZONE.com, written by [Martin Farrell](https://dzone.com/users/438281/farrelmr.html)

To run this code:
1) Run the unit tests (they will initially fail)
2) Insert cool streaming code on comments that say, `//  cool streaming code here`
3) Repeat until all tests pass

If you get stuck, checkout the `solution` branch.
